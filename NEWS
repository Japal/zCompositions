RELEASE HISTORY OF THE "zCompositions" PACKAGE
==============================================

CHANGES IN zCompositions VERSION 1.3.1 [2019-05]:
----------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* multRepl allows to impute missing data (BETA).
* multReplus: new function to simultaneously deal with zeros and missing data by multiplicative simple replacement (BETA).

MODIFICATIONS

* lrEM: multiplicative simple replacement can be also used to initiate the EM algorithm for missing data imputation.
* Minor bugs fixed.
* Updated documentation.

CHANGES IN zCompositions VERSION 1.2.0 [2019-02]:
----------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* lrEMplus: new function to simultaneously deal with zeros and missing data based on the EM algorithm.

MODIFICATIONS

* zPatterns able to separate zero and missingness patterns. New warnings about either zeros or NAs not identified by the label argument.
* Updated documentation.

CHANGES IN zCompositions VERSION 1.1.2 [2018-11]:
----------------------------------------------------

MODIFICATIONS

* Minor bug fixed.
* Updated documentation.

CHANGES IN zCompositions VERSION 1.1.1 [2017-08]:
----------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* lrEM now allows to impute missing data.
* zVarArray: variation arrays by zero/unobserved data patterns or groups.
* zVarArrayError: squared relative errors in variation arrays across groups.
* zVarArrayTest: homogeneity test of variation arrays across groups.
* lcTest: homogeneity test of log-contrast across groups.

MODIFICATIONS

* Improved documentation.
* Verbosity controlled throughout by suppress.print argument.
* zPatterns: argument to show means (geometric or arithmetic) by pattern included.


CHANGES IN zCompositions VERSION 1.0.3-1 [2016-04]:
----------------------------------------------------

MODIFICATIONS

* References updated and adaptation to new CRAN policies.

CHANGES IN zCompositions VERSION 1.0.3 [2014-09]:
----------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* Support for multiple limits of detection/threshold values by component.
* Choice for storing multiply imputed data sets in lrDA function.
* multKM: new non-parametric imputation method added.
* splineKM: visualisation of Kaplan-Meier and cubic spline smoothed empirical cumulative distribution function (helper function for multKM).
* New example data set included (Water).

MODIFICATIONS

* Alternative imputation by multRepl in lrEM and lrDA of censoring patterns with only one observed component.

* Fixed problem that caused error when a censoring pattern consisted of a single sample.

* Improved documentation.

CHANGES IN zCompositions VERSION 1.0.1 [2014-06]:
----------------------------------------------------

* Minor bugs in error messages fixed.

* cmultRepl: label argument added (default label = 0).

CHANGES IN zCompositions VERSION 1.0.0 [2014-05]:
----------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* cmultRepl function: bayesian-multiplicative replacement of compositional count zeros included.

* lrDA function: data augmentation algorithm, including multiple imputation, to replace left-censored values.

* zPatterns function: summarises the patterns of unobserved values (censored, nondetects, ...) in a data set and generates a vector of labels.

MODIFICATIONS

* General revision and optimisation. Documentation improvements.

* multLN: parameter estimates based on the normal distribution on the positive real line. Random imputation based on truncated normal instead of rejection method.

* Re-scaling to preserve ratios that leaves absolute observed values unaltered when working with non-closed data now implemented for all the methods (continuous data). 

* The replacement methods include an argument 'label' allowing the user to enter the label (special character, number, ...) denoting unobserved value in a data set.

* Error handling introduced.

* New lrEM function: replaces previous alrEM function and implements both ordinary and robust EM-based imputation methods. New arguments allow to specify the method to obtain initial estimates and the convergence criterion.
