\title{
Log-ratio SVD algorithm (plus) 
}
\description{
This function implements an extended version of the log-ratio SVD algorithm (\code{lrSVD} function) to simultaneously deal with both zeros (i.e. data below detection limit, rounded zeros) and missing data in compositional data sets.

Note: zeros and missing data must be labelled using 0 and \code{NA} respectively to use this function.
}
\usage{
lrSVDplus(X, dl = NULL, frac = 0.65,
             ncp = 2, beta = 0.5, method = c("ridge", "EM"), row.w = NULL,
             coeff.ridge = 1, threshold = 1e-04, seed = NULL, nb.init = 1,
             max.iter = 1000, z.warning = 0.8, ...)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
\item{X}{Compositional data set (\code{\link{matrix}} or \code{\link{data.frame}} class).}

\item{dl}{Numeric vector or matrix of detection limits/thresholds. These must be given on the same scale as \code{X}.}

\item{frac}{Parameter for initial multiplicative simple replacement of left-censored data (see \code{\link{multRepl}}) (default = 0.65).}

\item{ncp}{Number of components in low-rank matrix approximation (default = 2).}

\item{beta}{Weighting parameter, balance between the two conditions in objective function (default = 0.5).}

\item{method}{Parameter estimation method for the iterative algorithm (\code{method = "ridge"}, default).}

\item{row.w}{row weights (default = NULL, a vector of 1 for uniform row weights).}

\item{coeff.ridge}{Used when \code{method = "ridge"} (default = 1).}

\item{threshold}{Threshold for assessing convergence (default = 1e-04).}

\item{seed}{Seed for random initialisation of the algorithm (default \code{seed = NULL}, unobserved values initially imputed by the column mean).}

\item{nb.init}{Number of random initialisations (default = 1).}

\item{max.iter}{Maximum number of iterations for the algorithm (default = 1000).}

  \item{z.warning}{
Print a warning message if the proportion of zeros/unobserved values in any column or row exceeds a given threshold (default \code{z.warning=0.8}).
}

\item{...}{Further arguments.}
}

\details{
The procedure starts with an initial imputation of zeros (using simple replacement with \code{frac*dl}) and missing values (using geometric mean imputation from observed data). Subsequently, the iterative algorithm is run until convergence (see \code{?lrSVD} for more details).
}
\value{
A \code{\link{data.frame}} object containing the imputed compositional data set in the same scale as the original.
