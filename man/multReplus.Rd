\title{
Multiplicative simple replacement (plus) 
}
\description{
This function implements an extended version of multiplicative simple imputation (\code{multRepl} function) to simultaneously deal with both zeros (i.e. data below detection limit, rounded zeros) and missing data in compositional data sets.

Note: zeros and missing data must be labelled using 0 and \code{NA} respectively to use this function.
}
\usage{
multReplus(X, dl = NULL, frac = 0.65, closure = NULL, z.warning = 0.8,
              delta = NULL)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{X}{
Compositional data set (\code{\link{matrix}} or \code{\link{data.frame}} class).
}
  \item{dl}{
Numeric vector or matrix of detection limits/thresholds. These must be given on the same scale as \code{X}.
}
  \item{frac}{
Fraction of the detection limit/threshold used for imputation (default = 0.65, expressed as a proportion).
}
  \item{closure}{Closure value used to add a residual part for imputation (see below).}
  \item{z.warning}{Threshold used to delete individual rows or columns including an excess of zeros/unobserved values (to be specify in proportions, default \code{z.warning=0.8}).}
  \item{delta}{This argument has been deprecated and replaced by \code{frac} (see package's NEWS for details).}
}

\details{
The procedure firstly replaces missing data using the estimated geometric mean based on the observed values and then zeros using \code{frac*dl}. The observed components are applied a multiplicative adjustment to preserve the multivariate compositional properties of the samples.

Note: negative values can be generated when unobserved components are a large portion of the composition, which is more likely for missing data (e.g in major chemical elements) and non-closed compositions. A workaround is to add a residual filling the gap up to the closure/total when possible. This is done internally when a value for \code{closure} is specified (e.g. \code{closure=10^6} if ppm or \code{closure=100} if percentages). The residual is discarded after imputation.

See \code{?multRepl} for more details.

\value{
A \code{\link{data.frame}} object containing the imputed compositional data set expressed in the original scale.
